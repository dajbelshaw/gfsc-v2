## Geeks for Social Change is a design studio influenced by ethics and ideas from socialist and cyborg feminism.

> _Many technological systems, when examined for context and overall design, are basically anti-people. People are seen as sources of problems while technology is seen as a source of solutions._
>
> &mdash; Ursula Franklin

Echoing Franklin’s words, we want to reframe the relationship between technology and people in order to make people the centre of our technological world. Our holistic consideration of problems, prioritising equality and community, delivers meaningful work that fits the situation.

We use technology (such as websites and apps) to build tools for community organising, help people get messages out, to try and create structural change in the world. Our focus is on holistic consideration of problems, with an emphasis on building simple things well and working with existing flows and processes

We’re committed to working with communities and social change organisations in practical ways that benefit everyone, using a holistic approach to technology and community.

We’re constantly learning and keeping up to date with the latest research and ideas to make people’s lives better in whatever way we can.

We have the skills to deliver a huge range of tech products -- we are geeks after all -- but won’t make anything you don’t need, focussing on simplicity and broad appeal over bells and whistles for the tech savvy. We want to deliver meaningful work that’s right for the situation in order to create a better society, and produce useful change for communities.

We don’t work with corporate clients, and think our ongoing practice reflects this: prioritising equality, people, skills, community and shared understanding.

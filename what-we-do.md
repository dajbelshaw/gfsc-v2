title: We work towards a fairer society using activism, technology, and research.

## At Geeks for Social Change we fuse our three areas of expertise – web development, research, and community work – in innovative and creative ways.

We work within the overlaps of this Venn diagram to create well-rounded outcomes that support your existing strengths and goals in the real world.

 * **Web development**. We make websites, apps and tools to revolutionise the working of your organisation, as well as static brochure sites that directly reflect the work you do. If you’re a web developer, we can help you research and engage with the community.
 * **Research**. We are academics with a long history of qualitative study in sociological and architectural fields. We conduct relevant fieldwork, gather user research, and suggest outcomes and solutions for your organisation.
 * **Community work**. Our practise is political and we are experienced activists involved in community organising, LGBTQ+ projects and anti-racism campaigns. We can help with setting up campaigns or putting in tech infrastructure for community groups.

If what you need falls outside these categories but you’re interested in our work, we still want to work with you.

Most of all we’re interested in projects that transcend these boundaries, so please get in touch.

## Led by Dr Kim Foale, we use a community-based approach to technology and research that helps organisations and social enterprises achieve their social aims.

We work in collaboration with people, organisations and communities to deliver tools, training and support for lasting and holistic change.

We use a digital inclusion centered approach to improve lives and transform neighbourhoods.

We can develop websites and apps, create training and support programs, conduct social science research, create partnerships, and strengthen communities.

We won an AAL Smart Ageing Prize in 2018 for our work on PlaceCal, a community organisaing tool aimed at reducing social isolation for the over 50s.
